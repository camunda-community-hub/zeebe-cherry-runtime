# What is the Cherry Runtime?

The Cherry Runtime is dedicated to execute Camunda 8 Connectors and Workers. It proved
It provides administrative pages to administrators and business developers.

![Cherry Runtime Overview](src/main/resources/static/img/CherryFrameworkOverview.png?raw=true)

For a quick execution, access the Tutorial chapter.

Collections of connectors/workers can be integrated in the Cherry Runtime. A collection is an application ready to execute.

This documentation gives information:
* for administrators, to start and administrate a Collection
* for BPM Designer,to access documentation, and download Element-Template in your modeler
* for developers, to develop a connector or a worker in the framework, to create a Collection.


## Administrator
Multiple collections used the Cherry Runtime (Office PDF, CMIS). Each collection embedded multiple connectors or runners.

Each collection is an application, available as a Java application, a JAR file or as a Docker image.

You can
* start a runtime, and upload inside any JAR
* start directly a collection.


Provide the information to connect the Zeebe engine, and start the application.
The framework provides then an administrative page to monitor execution.
![Cherry Main Page](doc/CherryMainPage.png?raw=true)

On this page, connectors/workers are visible with statistics. The administrator can stop a connector/worker 
and change the number of threads dedicated to the pool of execution.


## BPMN Designer
A Cherry collection is a set of connectors/workers. Within the administrative page, the designer can access 
all the different artifacts.

He can access the type of connector/worker and information about the input and the output of the connector. A list of BPMN errors thrown by the connector/worker is available.

He can download the Element-Templates of the collection to load it in the Modeler or in the Web Modeler. The design becomes very easy.

## For the Developer


The developer can focus on the connector development. He has to declare Input and Output in the description. 
These have different advantages:

* The Cherry runtime will manage documentation, and it doesn't need to worry about it
* the Template Modeler will be generated by the Cherry runtime.
* The Cherry runtime controls the contract. If a variable is mandatory, the Framework controls its existence. On the Execute() method, the developer does not need to worry about the variable.
* if the connector / runner declare a BPMN Error, the glue between the code and the throw is take in charge by the Cherry runtime.
 
Execution is managed by the Cherry runtime, and a lot of administrative function is included: start/stop, change the number of thread, and get statistics on the execution.
